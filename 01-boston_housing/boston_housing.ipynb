    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",

    "- `RM`: I would expect that an increase in the `RM` value leads to an increase in the `MEDV` value as a larger number of rooms indicates a larger home which usually commands a higher price. As such, a larger average number of rooms among homes in the neighbourhood may also indicate higher median value of homes as the neighbourhood would have bigger houses that fetch higher prices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `LSTAT`: I would expect a neighbourhood with a lower `LSTAT` percentage to have higher `MEDV` values as generally the \"lower class\" or working poor homeowners would not be able to afford higher priced homes. Hence, having a lower percentage of \"lower class\" or working poor homeowners indicates that the neighbourhood is more affluent and may be able to afford higher priced homes, raising the `MEDV` value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `PTRATIO`: I would expect that neighbourhoods with a lower `PTRATIO` would correlate to a higher `MEDV` value as it is generally seen that more affluent neighbourhoods with private schools would have smaller class sizes whereas public schools in \"lower class\" neighbourhoods have significantly larger class sizes. Hence a high `PTRATIO` would indicate large class sizes which may be reflective of public schools in less affluent areas, correlating with cheaper housing and lower `MEDV` value.\n"

Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "The grid search technique is a way of performing hyperparameter optimization through an exhaustive search over a manually predefined subset of the hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm. In this case, if we were to apply grid search to the decision tree model it would evaluate different models with different hyperparameters such as maximum depth of the tree, for example, depths 1, 3, 6 or 10. These models are evaluated using the cross validation set in which we pick the model with the best f1 score."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "In k-fold cross validation, the `k` refers to the number of buckets that the data will be separated into. We will then train the model `k` times, each time using a different bucket for testing and the remaining points for training. Without k-fold cross validation, separating the dataset into 3 partitions (train, validation, test), drastically reduces the number of samples used for training the data. This is especially problematic for smaller data sets. In addition, using the same validation set for grid search makes the result of the grid search highly dependent on the randomization of the split. Hence, to solve this issue, we use k-fold cross validation so that each model can be evaluated multiple times using a larger training set where the performance measure is averaged from the multiple evaluations, hence giving us a more complete picture when doing a grid search to tune the hyperparameters.

    "- K-fold is a cross-validation technique and not a testing technique.\n",
    "- Suppose you use all your data for training. What do you think will happen in this scenario?\n",
    "- Your model might overfit or underfit or it might be a good fit as well. If your model is underfitting you will know that from your train scores (which will be low). But if your model is overfitting, your train scores will be high. By first look it would seem you have done a great job in training, but most probably you have not. It is only after you test your model with the test set that you will know the real performance of your model. Using part of train set to test will always give good results if you are getting good train score (since your model is biased towards that data)\n",
    "- That’s why you always need a test set. But while training you cannot use your test set performance to improve your model, because that would make your model biased towards the test set. Hence you need to do cross-validation.\n",

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in scikit-learn versions 0.17 and 0.18.\n",
    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.\n",
    "  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. \n",
    "  - Assign the `GridSearchCV` object to the `'grid'` variable."

In line with the observations earlier, it makes sense that the predicted selling price is below average and more than 1 std dev away. Client 3 has the largest home with the most number of rooms in this subset as well as lowest neighbourhood poverty level and student-teacher ratio. We believe these homes to be more desirable and hence fetch a higher price as indicated by the predicted selling price which is about slightly more than twice the mean price and close to the maximum price. Client 1's home can be said to lie in between Client 2 and 3 and hence the predicted price of being closer to the average price is just about right."

    "The current model may be too simplistic as there are too few features to properly explain price variations in the real world. In addition, the data may be too outdated as home layouts may have changed, some homes in the data set may no longer be in existence as well as situations in the neighbourhood and neighbouring schools may have changed. For example, poverty level may have increased or decreased depending on development and other factors, student-teacher ratio may have changed due to many reasons such as increase in number of teachers or decrease in number of students. In addition, the location of the neighbourhood also plays a part in the price as land may not cost as much in rural areas hence rural areas may be able to build or purchase significantly larger homes at lower prices. While a neighbourhood may give some insights onto the general property prices, every home is different and may cost more or less depending on its furnishings, age and state of the home, and more. \n",
